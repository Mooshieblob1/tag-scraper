    print("- ⚡ WITHOUT credentials: Basic artist info only (post_count = 0)")
    print("- 🎯 Uses dedicated counts API: /counts/posts.json?tags=artist_name")
    print("- ⚙️ Can be toggled on/off for speed vs accuracy")

    print("\n🎯 EXAMPLE USAGE:")
    print("- Fast scrape (no post counts): ~2-4 hours for full database")
    print("- Accurate scrape (with post counts): ~10-20 hours for full database")
    print("- CSV export: Instant for existing data")
    print("- Search by post count: Only works if you've scraped with post counts enabled")
