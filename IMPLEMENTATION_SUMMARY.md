## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Rate Limiting Algorithm

```python
# Intelligent backoff calculation
backoff_time = base_wait * (2 ** attempt) * consecutive_factor * jitter

# Adaptive rate limiting triggers
if consecutive_429s >= 3:
    apply_adaptive_rate_limiting()
    
# Recovery after success
if consecutive_successes >= 10:
    gradually_recover_rate_limiting()
```

### Health Status Logic

- **🟢 Healthy**: No recent 429s, normal operation
- **🔄 Recovering**: Had 429s but making progress  
- **🟡 Warning**: 3+ consecutive 429s, being cautious
- **🔴 Critical**: 5+ consecutive 429s, heavily limited

### Adaptive Behavior

1. **Normal**: 6.7 req/sec baseline
2. **Warning**: Reduce to ~4 req/sec, short cooldown
3. **Critical**: Reduce to 0.5 req/sec, 5-30 minute cooldown
4. **Recovery**: Gradual return over 10+ successful requests

## 📊 Monitoring Capabilities
